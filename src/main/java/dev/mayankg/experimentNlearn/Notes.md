## In Java, the order of initialization of data members and execution of blocks and methods follows a specific sequence.

1. **Static Blocks**: Static blocks are executed when the class is loaded into memory by the class loader. They are
   executed only once, and they are executed in the order they appear in the class.

    ```java
    public class MyClass {
        static {
            // Static block 1
        }
        static {
            // Static block 2
        }
    }
    ```

2. **Static Variables Initialization**: Static variables are initialized after static blocks, in the order they appear
   in the class.

    ```java
    public class MyClass {
        static int staticVar1 = 10; // Static variable initialization
        static int staticVar2; // Static variable initialization

        static {
            // Static block
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Instance Variables Initialization**: Instance variables are initialized next, before the constructor is invoked.
   This includes both variable initialization and instance initializer blocks.

    ```java
    public class MyClass {
        int x = 5; // Instance variable initialization

        {
            // Instance initializer block
        }
    }
    ```

4. **Constructor**: Constructors are executed after the instance variables are initialized. Constructors initialize the
   newly created object.

    ```java
    public class MyClass {
        public MyClass() {
            // Constructor
        }
    }
    ```

5. **Method Execution**: Once the object is initialized, methods can be invoked on the object. Methods are executed in
   the order they are called.

    ```java
    public class MyClass {
        public void myMethod1() {
            // Method 1
        }

        public void myMethod2() {
            // Method 2
        }
    }
    ```

6. **Static Methods**: Static methods can be called directly on the class, and they are executed in the order they are
   called.

    ```java
    public class MyClass {
        public static void myStaticMethod1() {
            // Static method 1
        }

        public static void myStaticMethod2() {
            // Static method 2
        }
    }
    ```

## This table illustrates the visibility and access rules for the different access modifiers in Java.

| Access Modifier | Class | Package | Subclass | World |
|-----------------|-------|---------|----------|-------|
| `public`        | Yes   | Yes     | Yes      | Yes   |
| `protected`     | Yes   | Yes     | Yes      | No    |
| `default`       | Yes   | Yes     | No       | No    |
| `private`       | Yes   | No      | No       | No    |

- `public`: The member is accessible from anywhere.
- `protected`: The member is accessible within its own package, and by subclasses.
- `default` (no modifier): The member is accessible only within its own package.
- `private`: The member is accessible only within its own class.
