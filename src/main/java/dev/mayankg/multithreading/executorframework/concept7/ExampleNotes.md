# OnlineOrderProcessing Example Explanation

This example demonstrates how to use `CompletableFuture` to manage multiple asynchronous tasks in an order processing system, simulating the workflow of placing an order, processing payment, updating inventory, and sending notifications. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1 - Place Order
- The `placeOrder` method takes a customer ID, simulates placing an order, and returns an order ID.
- We initiate this task asynchronously using `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync()`. This allows us to run it on a separate thread and retrieve the order ID as the output, which will then be passed to the next steps.

### Step 2 - Process Payment
- Once the order ID is generated, `thenApplyAsync` triggers the `processPayment` method.
- Here, `processPayment` takes the order ID as input and simulates processing a payment for that order.
- `thenApplyAsync` uses the output of `placeOrder` as its input and continues the asynchronous chain.

### Step 3 - Update Inventory
- After the payment has been successfully processed, we call `updateInventory` using `thenAcceptAsync`, which accepts the order ID but does not produce a return value.
- Since `updateInventory` only performs an action and doesn’t return any result, we use `thenAcceptAsync` to simply accept the input from the previous stage.

### Step 4 - Send Notification
- Finally, we send a notification to the customer once the inventory update is complete. For this, we use `thenRunAsync`, which only executes an action without requiring input or producing output.
- `thenRunAsync` waits until all preceding tasks are complete before triggering `sendNotification`.

### Blocking and Completion
- We use `notificationFuture.get()` to block the main thread until all asynchronous tasks are finished.
- This ensures that the main program doesn’t terminate before the order processing workflow is fully completed, and the user receives a notification.

### Summary of CompletableFuture Methods Used
1. **`supplyAsync`**: Runs an asynchronous task that returns a result (`placeOrder`).
2. **`thenApplyAsync`**: Applies a function to the result of the previous task and returns a new result (`processPayment`).
3. **`thenAcceptAsync`**: Consumes the result of the previous task but does not return a new result (`updateInventory`).
4. **`thenRunAsync`**: Executes a task without taking input or returning output, just ensuring all prior tasks are complete (`sendNotification`).

This example showcases a flexible and structured approach to handling multiple dependent asynchronous operations in Java. The use of `CompletableFuture` allows clear and concise management of task sequencing and dependency handling, making it ideal for real-world, asynchronous processing requirements.
