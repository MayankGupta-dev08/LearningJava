# Docker Notes

- Note: replace the content with `<>` with appropriate value to run the cmd properly.
- `Dockerfile` files are w/o any extensions and `docker-compose` files uses `yml` or `ymal` extensions.
- Docker images can be generated using three (3) different ways:
  - with a Dockerfile which has a set of sequential instructions (basic/ traditional approach)
  - with the help of [Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io), we donâ€™t need to write a low-level Dockerfile
  - with the help of GoogleJib (open source java tool maintained by Google for building docker images of java applications)

## Docker Commands

### To build the image using the jar for the app

- Navigate to the path where both `Dockerfile` and `jar` for the app are present.
- Here name of the image that we want to build is `userapp` and tag for the image is `2.0.1`
- Execute the following cmd:

```shell
docker build . -t <image_name>:<image_tag>
```

### List all the docker images present in your docker server

```shell
docker images
```

### To display detailed image information for a given image id

```shell
docker image inspect <image_id>
```

### To remove a docker image with a particular image_id

```shell
docker images rm <image_id>
```

### To push a docker image with an image_tag for a user to their docker registry

```shell
docker image push docker.io/<user_name>/<image_name>:<image_tag>
```

### To pull a particular docker image with an image_tag from docker registry

```shell
docker image pull docker.io/<user_name>/<image_name>:<image_tag>
```

### To run a container using a particular docker image

- External/Host port that we have used `9090` and Internal/Container port is `9191`
- Here we have used image `userapp` and its tag is `2.0.1`

```shell
docker run -d -p <host_port>:<cont_port> <image_name>:<image_tag>
```

```shell
docker run -d --name <container_name> -p <host_port>:<cont_port> <image_id>
```

### List of all the docker container/process running/stopped

```shell
docker ps -a
```

### To show only running container/process

```shell
docker ps
```

### To create a new image from an exiting running container which was modified

- This is done, in case if we have added some files in the running container and once the container is stopped the
  changes will also vanish.

```shell
docker commit <container_id> <new_container_name>:<new_container_tag>
```

### Pushing the local images to the docker-hub registry

- docker login

```shell
docker login
```

- tag you image with your dockerHubId --> `mayankg/my-app_image:v2.0`

```shell
docker tag <image_name>:<image_tag> <docker_userId>/<image_name>:<image_tag>
```

- push your images. for example, image -->`mayankg/my-app_image:v2.0`

```shell
docker push <image_name>:<image_tag> <docker_userId>/<image_name>:<image_tag>
```

### To stop a running container

```shell
docker container stop <container_name>
```
```shell
docker container stop <container_id>
```

### To start a docker container which was stopped

```shell
docker container start <container_name>
```
```shell
docker container start <container_id>
```

### To pause all the processes within one or more running containers

```shell
docker container pause <container_id>
```

### To resume/unpause all the processes within one or more paused containers

```shell
docker container unpause <container_id>
```

### To kill one or more running containers instantly

```shell
docker container kill <container_id>
```

### To restart one or more containers

```shell
docker container restart <container_id>
```

### To inspect all the details for a given container id

```shell
docker container inspect <container_id>
```

### To fetch the logs of a given container id

```shell
docker container logs <container_id>
```

### To follow log output of a given container id

```shell
docker container logs -f <container_id>
```

### To run a bash shell inside a particular container

```shell
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash
```

### To remove one or more containers based on container ids

```shell
docker container rm <container_id>
```

### To remove all stopped containers

```shell
docker container prune
```

### List all the docker volumes

```shell
docker volumes
```

### To remove unused volumes

```shell
docker volume prune
```

### To clean up any unused data in the docker.

- Removing all stopped containers
- Removing all networks not used by at least one container
- Removing all dangling images (i.e., images not referenced by any container)
- Removing all dangling build cache

```shell
docker system prune -f
```

## Docker Compose Commands

### To start containers defined in the docker-compose.yml file

```shell
docker-compose up
```

### To start containers in detached mode (in the background)

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

### To stop containers defined in the docker-compose.yml file

```shell
docker-compose down
```

### To stop and remove containers, networks, and volumes

```shell
docker-compose down -v
```

### To rebuild containers

```shell
docker-compose up --build
```

### To list containers managed by docker-compose

```shell
docker-compose ps
```

### To view the logs of services

```shell
docker-compose logs <service_name>
```

### To run a command in a service container

```shell
docker-compose exec <service_name> <command>
```

### To run a command in a service container interactively

```shell
docker-compose exec <service_name> <command> -it
```

### To scale services (increase the number of containers)

```shell
docker-compose scale <service_name>=<number_of_containers>
```

### To run a single service in a composition

```shell
docker-compose run <service_name>
```

### To build images before starting services

```shell
docker-compose up --build
```

### To remove all containers

```shell
docker-compose rm -f
```

### To check the configuration of docker-compose.yml

```shell
docker-compose config
```
