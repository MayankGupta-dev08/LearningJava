## 1. Prefix Sum

- **Description of the pattern:**
    - Useful: When you need to calculate the sum of subarrays multiple times or need to calculate cumulative sums.
    - Prefix Sum involves preprocessing an array to create a new array where each element at index i represents the sum of the array from the start-up to i. This allows for efficient sum queries on subarrays.
    - Tip: You don't always need to have a new array to store the prefix sum. You can also use the same array to store the prefix sum. (array[i] = array[i] + array[i-1])

- **Sample Problem:** Given an array nums, answer multiple queries about the sum of elements within a specific
  range [i, j].
    - **Input:** nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], i = 1, j = 3
    - **Output:** 9
- **Explanation:**
  - Preprocess the array A to create a prefix sum array: P = [1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21].
  - To find the sum between indices i and j, use the formula: P[j] - P[i-1].
