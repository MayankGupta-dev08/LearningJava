# SOLID PRINCIPLES

## 1. Single Responsibility Principle

```text
A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
```

## 2. Open Closed Principle

```text
Class/Objects/entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
```

## 3. Liskov's Substitution Principle

```text
When extending a class, remember that you should be able to pass objects of the subclass in place of objects of the parent class without breaking the client code.
```

## 4. Interface Segregation Principle

```text
A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it does’t use, or clients should’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
```

## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle

```text
High-level classes shouldn’t depend on low-level classes. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions shouldn’t depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
```
